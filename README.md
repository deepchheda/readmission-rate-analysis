Use data-mining techniques to predict readmission rates.

# Problem Statement


Design and implement a model, run experiments on a real world data-set. 
The program should be a two-class classifier that can handle data-sets with
 an arbitrary number of features and instances.
 The language of implementation is up to you â€” the only requirement is that your program
 be able to interpret the data format specified below, and be able to classify instances
 and produce interesting statistics such as accuracy, variance, etc.
